TODO for iceaddr

* Better automation of geo data processing in db build scripts
* iceaddr_suggest relies on comma separator to separate street address and place name. Could be made smarter.
* Function to find region of a given pair of coordinates, e.g. which_region(lat,lon) == "Nor√∞urland"
* Incorporate Icelandic foreign city name data from Greynir?
